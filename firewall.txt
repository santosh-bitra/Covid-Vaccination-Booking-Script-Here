The firewall on this machine is custom made.
1. The file for custom firewall scripts are in the location /etc/firewall.

2. This location consists of 3 scripts that has been git pulled from the github

3. This was forked from the repo: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/firewallsetup

4. The scripts consists of a 3 files.

5. These can be directly executed by giving the script as command and enter.

6. The 'firewall' script will enable the execution and triggering of this  custom firewall

7. The scripts 'firewall-down' can be used to bring down the firewall when required.

8. /etc/firewallsetup/firewall-reload to reload or refresh the custom-iptables 

9. This has to be launched everytime ou start your machine.

10. This can be set for permanent by the below method
	 - systemctl enable iptables
	 - cd /etc/firewallsetup ; ./firewall
11. To push the iptables to be saved on startup:
	 - iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
	 - reboot

14. The Source Location: /etc/firewallsetup/firewall.sh

15. Currently this firewall is not enabled to start with init for every reboot hence 
    run the script as you start the machine everytime as this is 
    still needed to be fully understood
